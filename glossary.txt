chaining
    [prompt engineering]

    API results into one another: The results
    of one API call can be processed and fed
    back into another API call with a
    different prompt to expand the potential
    capabilities of a workflow.

    With only 2048 tokens, you need to make
    use of your real estate by providing
    instructions and making implicit
    information explicit.

benchmarking
    [prompt engineering]

    A single prompt getting a good response
    once might be enough for your use case,
    but generally we want to know how well
    different solutions hold up on a variety
    of use cases.
    
    Also important to understand where prompts
    designs outperform others.
