they are both governed by the laws of physics.

**** vim is like emacs
both are computer text editors.

**** Cars are like trains
both travel on tracks.

**** dolphins are like people
They are both members of the class Mammalia.

  Early computers were only conceived as
  calculating devices. Since ancient times,
  simple manual devices like the abacus aided
  people in doing calculations. Early in the
  Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices
  were built to automate long tedious tasks,
  such as guiding patterns for looms. More
  sophisticated electrical machines did
  specialized analog calculations in the early
  20th century. The first digital electronic
  calculating machines were developed during
  World War II. The first semiconductor
  transistors in the late 1940s were followed by
  the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and
  monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip
  technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the
  microprocessor and the microcomputer
  revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and
  versatility of computers have been increasing
  dramatically ever since then, with transistor
  counts increasing at a rapid pace (as
  predicted by Moore's law), leading to the
  Digital Revolution during the late 20th to
  early 21st centuries.

  Computers were invented to do math. Before
  computers, people used a tool called a slide
  rule to do math. Slide rules were hard to use,
  so people invented a new tool called a
  calculator. Calculators were hard to use, so
  people invented a new tool called a computer.
  Computers were hard to use, so people invented
  a new tool called a computer with a screen.
  Computers with screens were hard to use, so
  people invented a new tool called a computer
  you can touch

  Computers were invented to help people do math.
  People have been using simple machines like the abacus to help them do math for a long time.
  More complicated machines helped people do math faster.
  Now people can do math faster with computers.
