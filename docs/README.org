** _Stage 1_
This is a dockerized =pen.el= that makes use of both GPT-3 and GPT-j.

** _Stage 2_
This is a collaborative =pen.el= with an exploration tool like loom.

https://github.com/socketteer/loom

Store prompts in Datomic.

+ Stage 2
  - [ ] Generations stored in Datomic
  - [ ] Prompts stored in Datomic
  - [ ] Make use of arbitrarily many git repositories that store prompts

** Design
+ Completed [ ]
  - [X] Default behaviour of generated functions
    - [X] First argument may be selection
    - [ ]If selection then text is replaced by default
  - [X] Generate funxctions of composed prompts
  - [ ] Generate prompts from interactive keyboard macros
  - [ ] Development workflow
  - [ ] Search workflow
    - Semantic search for =straight.el=
    - Semantic search for =nixos.el=
    - Semantic concordance for =KJV bible=
