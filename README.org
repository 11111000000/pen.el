* =pen.el= : A package for prompt engineering in emacs

Prompt-Engineer Mode is a global minor mode for emacs that facilitates the
creation, development, discovery and usage of prompts to a language model.

- Create elisp functions based on GPT-3 prompts
- Chain GPT-3 queries together using keyboard macros and functions
- Interactively query, generate and transfrom both prose and code
- Use GPT-3 as a search engine within emacs
  - Search the internet
  - Search documents

+ Goals
  - Programmatically navigate GPT-3
  - Create useful prompts
  - Prototype NLP tasks with GPT-3
    - Substitute external tools for prototypes

** Works with
- OpenAI API (GPT-3)
  - https://beta.openai.com/
*** Planned
- =openai-server= (GPT-2)
  - https://github.com/shawwn/openai-server
  - Requires tensorflow 1
- DeepAI API
  - https://deepai.org/
- OpenAI API (GPT-4)
  - https://beta.openai.com/

** Requirements
*** =openai= =pip= library and command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  pip3 install openai
#+END_SRC
*** =openai= API key

** Usage

*** Enable =prompt-engineerer-mode= globally (on all buffers)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (pen-mode 1)

  ;; Alternatively
  (pen-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Current progress
+ Implementation [1/1]
  - [X] emacs-lisp functions are generated from YAML =.prompt= files
+ Design [2/2]
  - [X] Default behaviour of generated functions
    - [X] First argument may be selection
    - [ ]If selection then text is replaced by default
  - [X] Generate functions of composed prompts
  - [ ] Generate prompts from interactive keyboard macros
  - Development workflow
  - Search workflow
+ Portability [0/1]
  - [-] Use built-in elisp functions

** _How to crack an egg_ -- The obfuscated version
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  In order to understand the process of how to
  crack an egg, one must first understand the
  egg itself.
  
  Eggs are oval objects which are comprised of
  the remnants of expired cellular tissue, as
  the human body is comprised.
  
  The origin of the egg can be traced back to
  the reproductive organ of a female bird.
  
  Once the egg is laid, it is then incubated, a
  process which can take several weeks.
  
  The term “founders” refers in this case to a
  period where the human
#+END_SRC

*** Now let's summarize that paragraph for a 2nd grader.
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  An egg is a small round object that comes from
  a hen.
  
  It is made of the stuff that comes out of the
  hen's butt.
  
  The egg is like the human body, because the
  body is also made of the stuff that comes out
  of the butt.
  
  The egg is incubated for a few weeks.
  
  This means that it is kept warm so it can
  grow.
  
  The egg is like a human baby, because a human
  baby is also kept warm so it can grow.
  
  The hen is

** Creating some analogies
*** Strawberries are like the ocean because:

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  both are systems whose properties are best 
  appreciated from a distance.
#+END_SRC

*** Strawberries are like the ocean because:
Ok... We can adjust the analogy =.prompt= file.

I have adjusted it with a temperature of 0.7
so it can get really creative, and also
adjusted the presence penalty to make it a bit
more verbose.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
both need to be protected from pollution.
#+END_SRC

I actually really like this one.
