* =prompt-engineer-mode= (=PEn=)

Prompt-Engineer Mode is a global minor mode for emacs that facilitates the
creation, development, discovery and usage of prompts in your emacs.

- Create elisp functions based on GPT-3 prompts
- Chain GPT-3 queries together using keyboard macros and functions
- Interactively query, generate and transfrom both prose and code
- Use GPT-3 as a search engine within emacs
  - Search the internet
  - Search documents

** Works with
- OpenAI API (GPT-3)
  - https://beta.openai.com/
*** Planned
- =openai-server= (GPT-2)
  - https://github.com/shawwn/openai-server
  - Requires tensorflow 1
- DeepAI API
  - https://deepai.org/
- OpenAI API (GPT-4)
  - https://beta.openai.com/

** Requirements
*** =openai= =pip= library and command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  pip3 install openai
#+END_SRC
*** =openai= API key

** Usage

*** Enable =prompt-engineerer-mode= globally (on all buffers)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n :async :results verbatim code
  (prompt-engineer-mode 1)

  ;; Alternatively
  (pen-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Default Key Bindings
| key binding    | description    |
|----------------+----------------|
| <kbd>SPC</kbd> | =pen-generate= |

** Current progress
+ Implementation [1/1]
  - [X] emacs-lisp functions are generated from YAML =.prompt= files
+ Design [1/1]
  - [X] Default behaviour of generated functions
    - [X] First argument may be selection
    - [ ]If selection then text is replaced by default
+ Portability [0/1]
  - [-] Use built-in elisp functions

** Examples
*** Create analogy
**** earth is like the universe
they are both governed by the laws of physics.

**** vim is like emacs
both are computer text editors.

**** Cars are like trains
both travel on tracks.

**** dolphins are like people
They are both members of the class Mammalia.

*** abstractive summarization
**** computers

  Early computers were only conceived as
  calculating devices. Since ancient times,
  simple manual devices like the abacus aided
  people in doing calculations. Early in the
  Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices
  were built to automate long tedious tasks,
  such as guiding patterns for looms. More
  sophisticated electrical machines did
  specialized analog calculations in the early
  20th century. The first digital electronic
  calculating machines were developed during
  World War II. The first semiconductor
  transistors in the late 1940s were followed by
  the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and
  monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip
  technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the
  microprocessor and the microcomputer
  revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and
  versatility of computers have been increasing
  dramatically ever since then, with transistor
  counts increasing at a rapid pace (as
  predicted by Moore's law), leading to the
  Digital Revolution during the late 20th to
  early 21st centuries.

***** Simplification 1
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Computers were invented to do math. Before
  computers, people used a tool called a slide
  rule to do math. Slide rules were hard to use,
  so people invented a new tool called a
  calculator. Calculators were hard to use, so
  people invented a new tool called a computer.
  Computers were hard to use, so people invented
  a new tool called a computer with a screen.
  Computers with screens were hard to use, so
  people invented a new tool called a computer
  you can touch

***** Simplification 2 -- I like this one
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Computers were invented to help people do math.
  People have been using simple machines like the abacus to help them do math for a long time.
  More complicated machines helped people do math faster.
  Now people can do math faster with computers.

**** jupiter
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and
  the largest in the Solar System.

  It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth
  that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that
  of all the other planets in the Solar System
  combined.

  Jupiter is one of the brightest objects
  visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and
  has been known to ancient civilizations since
  before recorded history.

  It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.

  When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright
  enough for its reflected light to cast visible
  shadows, and is on average the third-brightest
  natural object in the night sky after the Moon
  and Venus.
